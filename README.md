Change of course fields:
- Add corequisites
- Add classComment
- courseWebLinks has disappeared (it was useless anyway)
- Add duration to assessments
- In requisites and corequisites, ["code", "title"] has replaced  {"Code": "subject", "Title": "courseTitle"}
- Convenor is now a string (name of the person), not an object
