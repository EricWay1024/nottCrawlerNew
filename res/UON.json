    "summary": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\n<p>The focus of this module is acquiring skills and applying clinical psychology expertise across the human life span and spectrum of diversity, thereby complementing the taught LPD module. During second year placements students normally work in two different service settings and extend the knowledge and competences acquired in the Foundation Placement modules through work with services dedicated to different age groups, clients with divergent developmental pathways and those with disabilities. In addition, students develop competences in relation to people who present with more complex clinical problems and/or circumstances where greater</p><p>consideration has to be given to intervening with couples, families, groups and indirectly through others. In MPA, students are encouraged to contemplate client groups, service settings and evidence-based practice approaches alternative to CBT that interest them, for which the taught SIM module provides the theoretical foundations.</p><p>This module provides students with opportunities for working in the NHS and in other complex organisations, such as schools, social services, residential care and institutions to develop proficient knowledge of specialised interventions for targeted client groups.</p><p>Relationship to External Bodies Approved by Health &amp; Care Professions Council.

    "aims": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\nThe aim is to enable students to identify the nature of clients\u2019 problems in the context of their position in the life span and to become more sophisticated in their awareness of the range of human abilities and developmental paths. Having secured a knowledge and skills base in working with individuals, students progress to analysing problems and generating appropriate interventions, taking account of a wider range of interacting factors including consideration of the individual as part of a couple, family, group or community. Placements normally provide enhanced opportunities for treating clients within couple, family or group modalities, introducing students to the social context of services and the role of the clinical psychologist in the multi-disciplinary team. While working with clients, students become increasingly adept at recognising the needs of carers and care staff, the appropriateness of working in partnership with other professions and agencies and gain practical experience of service level interventions.\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",

    "summary": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\n<p>This module lays the foundation for the research component of the programme by introducing students to: the most influential study designs used in clinical psychology, theoretical and practical aspects of conducting applied research in healthcare settings, and systematically searching relevant literature to answer specific clinical and research questions. In the first part of the module, students develop a defensible plan for a doctoral-level research project and, acquire the skill of writing formal research proposals for university and/or NHS ethics committees (taking due account of the principles of ethical research and the requirements of the HCPC, BPS, and other bodies as appropriate).</p><p>This module also provides students with an opportunity to develop their evidence searching, appraisal, and synthesis skills by undertaking a systematic review of the literature in their chosen area of interest. The systematic literature review results in a doctoral-level publication-ready paper, which generates new knowledge and forms a component of the final research project portfolio (RAP). This module is the first step students take toward the completion of their research project portfolio and submission-ready journal papers.</p><p>Relationship to External Bodies: Approved by Health &amp; Care Professions Council.

    "aims": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\nThe aim of part one of this module is to equip students to complete doctoral-level research by developing their ability to highlight gaps and inconsistencies in existing knowledge through critical and systematic analysis of relevant literature; utilising that knowledge to formulate suitable research aims, questions, and hypotheses; and learning how to address research questions through manageable, appropriate, and replicable research design.Students are also taught how to plan data analyses using a range of quantitative and qualitative methods, while giving due consideration to appropriate methods of dissemination and the possible impact of findings on clinical practice.The module also aims to consolidate and practically apply students\u2019 knowledge of the methodology of systematic literature reviews. The module develops students\u2019 abilities to identify and interrogate appropriate literature sources (including but not limited to electronic databases); identify and refine search strategies; select, obtain, and critically evaluate publications; and synthesise the sourced material into an organising narrative to advance knowledge in the field of clinical psychology.This module is embedded in the context of the core philosophy of the profession of Clinical Psychology: the module socialises trainees into the scientist-practitioner role that will be central to their professional practice.\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",
