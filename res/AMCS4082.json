  "summary": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\n<p>This module introduces students to the key Research Skills required for successful completion of an MRes in any discipline within the School of Cultures, Languages and Area Studies. It will enable students to become more effective researchers and develop a range of transferable professional skills\u2014from writing and presentation to public engagement and project management. Routes through the module include compulsory and elective courses offered by the Faculty of Arts Researcher Skills Programme, the central Graduate School Researcher Development Programme, and the Social Sciences and Arts Graduate Centre Programme. Students will work with their supervisors to identify which of the skills from these programmes they should prioritise for their development. In addition, students will be required to attend their Department\u2019s Postgraduate Professional Development Programme (which incorporates occasional seminars and postgraduate-led events alongside weekly peer review sessions and lectures by visiting academics). These sessions are intended to give students the opportunity to receive detailed feedback on their written work from their peers, and allow them to develop a range of important skills relating to critical interrogation, intellectual clarity, and verbal articulacy. These skills will prove crucial to the successful completion of their degree and in relation to things such as conference presentations, funding applications and (academic or non-academic) job interviews. The minimum expectation of students is that they complete the two mandatory courses from the Graduate School Researcher Programme in this semester and regularly attend Work-in-Progress sessions within their Department. Their initial Development Needs Analysis can then be further refined after the completion of these strands. The core assessment element of this module, the Literature Review, is a significant first step in establishing the theoretical framework and source base for the MRes dissertation. The feedback on it provided by the student\u2019s supervisors will enable them to go on to plan the overall chapter structure and basic thesis of their dissertation, as well as develop an awareness of any archival resources that may need to be drawn on in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",
