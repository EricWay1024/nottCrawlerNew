    "summary": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\n<p>The magazine has been one of the most accessible and one of the most influential cultural forms in America since the mid-18th century. From the wide-ranging political and literary magazines of this founding period through the emergence of specialized and mass-market periodicals in the 19th century to the counter-cultural and consumerist magazines of the 20th century this distinctive mode of publication has reflected the tensions and ideals of a rapidly developing society. Using a broad range of representative magazines from different eras this module will encourage students to get to grips with how American culture has shaped, and been shaped by, the periodical, and it will also introduce them to some of the unique literary and institutional qualities of the magazine. Primary sources covered on this module are likely to include The Dial (est. 1840), Harper's (est. 1850), The New Yorker (est. 1925), Life (est. 1936) and Rolling Stone (est. 1967). Looked at in the context of their times such sources show us how Americans have long engaged with and debated their own identity through the prism of print, as well as the ways in which this self-definition has changed across time. Moreover, alongside the magazine's regular testing of new political and cultural concepts we will be able to see how the periodical form itself embraced other emerging media: illustration, photography, popular music etc.<br>The main content-spine through each week will be a focus on changes in the nature of American journalism, the rise of modern advertising, and the development of the short story as a form, as well as the interactions between these three elements. In addition to the standard lecture/seminar set-up the module will also incorporate a series of workshops focusing on hands-on study of hard copies of particular publications.</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",

    "summary": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\n<p>This interdisciplinary module examines the role played by American popular music in countercultural movements. It focuses on the ways in which marginalised, subordinate or dissenting social groups have used popular music as a vehicle for self-definition and for re-negotiating their relationship to the social, economic and cultural mainstream. It explores how the mainstream has responded to music countercultures in ways that range from repression to co-optation. And it analyses how the music and the movements have been represented and reflected on in fiction, film, poetry, journalism and theory. A central concern of the module is to evaluate the effectiveness and potential of popular music as a socially-critical or oppositional force. The module is built around case studies of key issues and moments in American popular music history. One of the key issues is the debate over the ownership and use of African-American musical resources, from nineteenth-century minstrelsy to twenty-first century hip-hop.&nbsp;Another is the function of commercial entertainment institutions in mediating between music subcultures, political countercultures, and the mainstream culture. Among the key moments examined are the folk revival and the 1930s Popular Front, rock 'n' roll&nbsp;and desegregation in the 1950s, rock music and the 1960s counterculture, and&nbsp;postmodernism and identity politics in the music of the MTV age, and the relationship between hip hop culture and neoliberalism in the early twenty-first century.</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",

How has this term come under pressure and fractured over the past half century or so? This module will examine these questions by building on knowledge and study skills acquired by students in level 1 and level 2 classes that touch upon North American film, television and literature. It will do so by considering the concept of the mid and late twentieth century American classic in a variety of contrasting and overlapping contexts. These contexts will be elaborated on the basis of their formal, generic, period and/or cultural designations that will cover university and exam curricula reading lists, popular opinion and widespread critical consensus (such as the currently prevalent view, for instance, that the early twenty-first century constitutes a \u2018golden age\u2019 of US television).

It will enable students to become more effective researchers and develop a range of transferable professional skills\u2014from writing and presentation to public engagement and project management. Routes through the module include compulsory and elective courses offered by the Faculty of Arts Researcher Skills Programme, the central Graduate School Researcher Development Programme, and the Social Sciences and Arts Graduate Centre Programme. Students will work with their supervisors to identify which of the skills from these programmes they should prioritise for their development. In addition, students will be required to attend their Department\u2019s Postgraduate Professional Development Programme (which incorporates occasional seminars and postgraduate-led events alongside weekly peer review sessions and lectures by visiting academics). These sessions are intended to give students the opportunity to receive detailed feedback on their written work from their peers, and allow them to develop a range of important skills relating to critical interrogation, intellectual clarity, and verbal articulacy. These skills will prove crucial to the successful completion of their degree and in relation to things such as conference presentations, funding applications and (academic or non-academic) job interviews. The minimum expectation of students is that they complete the two mandatory courses from the Graduate School Researcher Programme in this semester and regularly attend Work-in-Progress sessions within their Department. Their initial Development Needs Analysis can then be further refined after the completion of these strands. The core assessment element of this module, the Literature Review, is a significant first step in establishing the theoretical framework and source base for the MRes dissertation. The feedback on it provided by the student\u2019s supervisors will enable them to go on to plan the overall chapter structure and basic thesis of their dissertation, as well as develop an awareness of any archival resources that may need to be drawn on in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",

It will cover a range of case studies between Luce\u2019s injunction and the subsequent US entry into World War Two in 1941 and the recent twin-crises marked by the 2008 Great Recession and the Covid-19 global pandemic. In doing so, it will prompt students to consider both the projection of American power on a global scale after 1941 and the considerable challenges that this project faced. Incorporating a series of focused case studies and reflections on the wider contexts relating to them, it will give students first-hand experience of weighing up the practical challenges US policymakers faced and the way that historians have subsequently assessed their efforts and understood their actions. It will make extensive use of recent scholarship that has upended the idea that, in an age when it was the world\u2019s leading power, the US was able to effortlessly project its influence all over the globe. Rather, it will demonstrate the innate limits of America\u2019s global project and chart the considerable difficulties that US policymakers confronted in seeking to bend the world to their will. It will conclude with some reflections on the present state of US power. The case studies it will include are: 1) 1940 and American Globalism; 2) The Bandung Conference, the Global Race Revolution, and the Cold War; 3) The Vietnam Wars; 4) The 1973 Oil Shocks and Globalization; 5) Iran-Contra, the CIA, and Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cold War in the Global South; 6) The Great Recession and Covid-19.</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",

    "summary": "<div class=\"ps-htmlarea\">\n<!-- Begin HTML Area Name Undisclosed -->\n<p>This interdisciplinary module examines the role played by American popular music in countercultural movements. It focuses on the ways in which marginalised, subordinate or dissenting social groups have used popular music as a vehicle for self-definition and for re-negotiating their relationship to the social, economic and cultural mainstream. It explores how the mainstream has responded to music countercultures in ways that range from repression to co-optation. And it analyses how the music and the movements have been represented and reflected on in fiction, film, poetry, journalism and theory. A central concern of the module is to evaluate the effectiveness and potential of popular music as a socially-critical or oppositional force. The module is built around case studies of key issues and moments in American popular music history. One of the key issues is the debate over the ownership and use of African-American musical resources, from nineteenth-century minstrelsy to twenty-first century hip hop. Another is the function of commercial entertainment institutions in mediating between music subcultures, political countercultures, and the mainstream culture. Among the key moments examined are the folk revival and the 1930s Popular Front, rock 'n' roll and desegregation in the 1950s, rock music and the 1960s counterculture, postmodernism and identity politics in the music of the MTV age and the relationship between hip hop culture and neoliberalism in the early twenty-first century.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- End HTML Area -->\n</div>\n",

It provides historical and political analyses of U.S. foreign relations, looking at the themes and traditions that have shaped America's increasing influence in global affairs from the late nineteenth century to the present day. From the war of 1898 to the conflicts of the early twenty-first century, it examines how America's involvement abroad has changed over time. How can we understand the evolution of America's relationship with the wider world; what interests and themes have lay behind the execution of American power? The course analyses traditional political and diplomatic issues, as well as the link between foreign and domestic policies, the role of foreign actors and private organisations-from religious groups to citizen organisations to NGOs that have served to shape America's actions abroad. It also engages with important contemporary trends in the historiography of U.S. foreign policy, including those that emphasise the significance of race, gender, emotions, and religion.</p><p>Students who need to complete one or more components of assessment during the summer, due to extenuating circumstances or for progression purposes, will be required to submit one essay of 2,000 words. This form of assessment has been set in order to accommodate early submission deadlines for candidates undertaking a year of study abroad, who will not be resident in Nottingham during the usual summer examination period.

The notion of the \"regional\" will be applied expansively as well as conventionally to incorporate everything from the urban to the suburban/exurban; border territories; immigrant communities and transnational outlets for expressions of North American culture and values. Possible areas of study may include the American South; \"mountain\" people; Hispanic-America; Indigenous Peoples; Texas; Chicago; New Orleans; California; and the transnational impact of extensive US Military occupations (post-war Japan; South Vietnam; C21st Iraq).</p><p>Students who need to complete one or more components of assessment during the summer, due to extenuating circumstances or for progression purposes, will be required to submit one essay of 2000 words.
